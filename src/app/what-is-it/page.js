                     Welcome to "Memorize Me" â€” a digital gallery of cherished moments, created as part of a study project and based on our concept.
                     The main idea of this website is to store your memories in one place. Simply upload your photos and specify the date when they
                     were taken. It's simple, fast, and free.

                  <p className='text-lg text-primary'>
                     Our goal is to create a clean, beautiful, and convenient website for everyone who wants to store their memories in an easy way.
                     While developing the website, we compared many different technologies and popular services for storing photos, blogs, and other
                     data. We found that most popular services are not free and contain ads, pop-ups, and user tracking. We want to create something
                     different: a service that is free, without ads, pop-ups, or tracking, and designed for a niche audience that values these
                     details.

                     Inspired by aesthetics and a desire for simplicity, we created this website. We hope it will be both enjoyable and useful for
                     you.
