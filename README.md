# Memorize me

Welcome to **"Memorize me"** â€” a digital gallery of cherished moments, created as part of a study project and based on our concept

## What is it?

The main idea of this website is to store your memories in one place. Simply upload your photos and specify the date when they were taken. It's dead simple and smooth

## Our Goal

Our goal is to create a smooth and beautiful website for everyone who wants to store their memories in an easy way. While developing the website, we compared many different technologies and popular services for storing photos, blogs, and other data. We found that most popular services are not free and contain ads, pop-ups, and user tracking. We want to create something different: a service that is free, without ads, pop-ups, or tracking, and designed for a niche audience that values these details

## Inspiration and Simplicity

Inspired by aesthetics and a desire for simplicity, we created this website. We hope it will be both enjoyable and useful

## Technologies

This project was built using modern technologies and trends, such as:
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Framer-motion

## Next plans

- Add backend
- Host website
